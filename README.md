# c64-tea

Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) for Commodore 64 using BASIC and 6502 ASM.

I saw this was called "Tiny Encryption Algorithm" and wanted to test if it was "tiny" enough to run on a Commodore 64.
I also wanted to get practice with using machine code in BASIC programs and refresh on 6502 assembly.
